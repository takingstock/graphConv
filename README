tis code is oin to serve as te base for experiments on underlyin strucure of documents
It basically extracts multiple features from an underlyin document like
- text features
- convolution features ( raw image passed into stacked conv )
- positional encoding
- sequence of text
and finally mushes all of it into a gcn and passes it into a multi hhead attention block and finally outputs a sigmoid / multi label
classification on whether the text/text box is relevant AND its label if relevant
